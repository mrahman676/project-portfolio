      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I have up to 4 years of experience working in Clinical Trials, with a significant proportion working in Phase 1 Volunteer Recruitment & Screening. I have experience conducting telephone pre-screening calls to assess volunteer eligibility, performing respiratory observations during screening and have experience as a study lead in overseeing the entire recruitment process. I have also experience recruiting patients onto a range of studies whilst working within NHS Clinical Research. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I boast excellent communication and interpersonal skills, I have a dearth of experience within clinical research, and have learned a range of IT skills using Microsoft Office (Word, Excel & PowerPoint) and clinical data entry tools. I am currently looking to move into a Junior Software Developer role and have undertaken a 16 week Front End Developer Bootcamp where I will be learning to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS & NodeJS.</p>
